* "This project is done during a Coursera course called: Object Oriented Programming in Java"
* Understanding the object-oriented concepts
* Showing the map via PApplet class with assisting of unfolding map library
* Showing earthquake data live on a map
* Putting markers for the earthquake based on the data file was extracted from ...
* Each marker on the map represents the information about its magnitude, depth, exact location
* The shape, size, and color of the markers indicate the size of magnitude and they also show the recent earthquakes happen throughout the world
* Adding some interactivity like responding to mouse movement and mouse clicks
* Result1: A list of earthquakes happen on land and in the ocean with their numbers
* Result2: Hovering over the markers: shows the information related to that marker
* Result3: Clicking on a specific marker: Shows the markers(cities) effected by that earthquake and hide the others
